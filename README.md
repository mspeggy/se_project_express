# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12


Tech Stack & Approach 

This project uses a modern Node.js backend stack to ensure clean, reliable, and maintainable code.

Technologies Used
- Node.js – Runtime environment
- Express – Backend framework for routing and request handling
- MongoDB – NoSQL database used to store application data
- Mongoose – ODM for modeling schemas and interacting with the database

Development Tools & Techniques
- Nodemon – Enables hot-reload during development
- ESLint – Code linting for consistent style
- Prettier – Automatic code formatting
- REST API Architecture – Modular controllers, routers, and middleware
- User Authorization – Planned/implemented JWT or similar strategy
